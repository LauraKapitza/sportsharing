# Module 2 | Project: Sportsharing

## Introduction

Module 2 is focused on learning the Backend Framework.</br>
Project 2 aim is to create and present a full-stack app having users and all CRUD operations.</br>

For this we used the following technologies which we had acquired during this Module:

- MongoDB & Mongoose, 
- Handlebars, 
- Axios.

## Pitch:

Sportsharing is the web application where people can organize sport events with other sport enthusiasts.
